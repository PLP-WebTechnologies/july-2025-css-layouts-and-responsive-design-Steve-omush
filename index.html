            <h3>Whale Rider</h3>
            <p>
              Kahu is the eldest great-grandchild of chief Koro Apirana; had she
              been a boy, she would have been the future leader of the tribe but
              since she is a girl, she is detested by her grandfather Koro
              Apirana who is a male chauvinist who is blinded by culture. She is
              attuned to the traditional Māori way of life, and has inherited
              the ability to speak to whales. The novel is narrated by Kahu's
              uncle, Rawiri, who travels to Australia and Papua New Guinea where
              the narrative focuses on the shaping of his own understanding of
              his Māori identity
